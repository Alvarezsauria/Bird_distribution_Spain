## <span style="color:green"> Context and objective </span>

>*Birds are a miracle because they prove to us there is a finer, simpler state of being which we may strive to attain*
>> *Douglas Coupland*

Can you imagine life without birds?
They play a vital role in controlling pests and acting as pollinators. In addition, birds are important to humans in many ways, such as serving as a source of food and providing fertilizer in agricultural settings.
They are not just creatures that beautify our planet but they also contribute to the balance and the operation of our ecosystem. 
**As humans, we are responsible for their endangerment and preservation.**


## <span style="color:green"> Antecedentes </span>

Our aim is to study the distribution of birds in Spain, in search of inconsistencies in the patterns.
We have found that

With more than 12 million of registers from observations in Spain, we study the distribution of 604 species, and their tendence over the past 20 years (low data volume prior to 2000)


## <span style="color:green"> Data & Tech </span>

- Initial dataset: *EOD â€“ eBird Observation Dataset* from GBIF, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
    - EDA: Pandas, numpy, itertools
- Enrichment data: API call to the IUCN Red List *International Union for Conservation of Nature*
    - Request,json
- Visualizacion: Tableau

## <span style="color:green"> Conclusions </span>
- The record of bird sightings have grown exponentially in recent years, proportionally in the different spanish regions
- Despite the natural stability of birds in their geographical distribution, we found species with an unstable distribution over the years
- Through the study of these "unstable distribution species" and their category in the Red List, we find that those with a **decreasing population volume are aquatic birds**

As a result of these conclusions, we suggest a line of research centered on two lines:
- Marine waters: water pollution, overbuilding and traffic in nearby areas, effects of fishing
- Wetlands and fresh waters: use of pesticides in agriculture, transformation of humid areas into crops, drought
